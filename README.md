# React + Vite
This is a music E-commerce website. It is responsive from small mobile devices to large PCs and Desktops. I made up the design by myself without a help of a designer, so UI/UX context may not the best practice. 

Used content:
React: JS Framework.
SCSS: for design. I used  variables and nesting.
React-Router: For routing to links.
React-icons: For Icons.
Context API: I used for context and reducer.
Data: I used mock, dummy data for content created by my.

USE npm install for dependencies and the npm run dev for developer mode, its made by vite. See the deployed version on the provided link or use npm run build and npm run preview.# MusiShop
